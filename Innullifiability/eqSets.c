// ========================== EQUIVALENT SETS ==========================

// This program is my approach to finding nullifiable sets quickly and
// efficiently. Rather than enumerating each set and performing some
// exhaustive test on it to see if it's nullifiable, this will instead
// 'dream up' nullifiable sets based on patterns that lead to
// nullifiability.

// This all works based off the notion of 'equivalent pairs'--pairs of
// values that, by some allowed arithmetic operation, equal a particular
// value. For example, the value 2 could have the equivalent pair
// (3, 5), since 5 - 3 = 2, and (4, 8), since 8 / 4 = 2. Since we are
// only dealing with sets without repetition, things like (1, 1) or 
// (2, 4) don't count. Given a set, any value can be substituted with
// any of its equivalent pairs (assuming that wouldn't cause a
// repetition with some other value), and that set can still equal at
// least all the same values by performing arithmetic operations, since
// we know the values of the equivalent pair can definitely be made
// equal to the original value.

// This program computes all equivalent pairs of values that can occur
// in a set, that is, pairs equivalent to values 1-M by means of only
// values 1-M. Then, for any set given, it can find 'equivalent sets' by
// iterating over every value in a set and replacing it with every
// equivalent pair for that value, all the while calling some
// function provided by a function pointer, passing in sets as they are
// generated, and recursing on new sets as they are generated.

// So what does this have to do with nullifiability? Well, the only way
// for a set to be nullifiable is by it having some means of getting a
// value to equal another value, so that they can be subtracted and then
// that zero can be multiplied to any remaining values. Given this, we
// can start from a base set containing two of the same value, and then
// repeatedly expand by equivalent pairs up to as many elements as a set
// can allow. As we keep going, the set will continue to have a route to
// equalling zero. Any sets we calculate along the way, as well as their
// supersets, can be marked as nullifiable.

// It's important to realize though that this cannot cover all possible
// equivalent sets. The equivalent pairs, being 1-M only, cannot cover
// arithmetic results going outside the range of values used within the
// sets, even though those may be necessary for a set being equivalent
// to a particular value. I could fix this by implementing something
// complex which keeps track of the number of arithmetic steps and all
// the possible values at each step and blah blah blah complicated, but
// for what it's worth, this will eliminate a whole lot of sets anyways,
// and quickly. Nevertheless, there will have to be a sort of manual
// check to essentially weed out any stragglers after this passes over.

// Reconfigure Equivalent Set Generation
// Returns 0 on success, -1 on memory error, -2 on input error

// This function will reset the equivalent set generation program, which
// just involves making space for all the equivalent pairs we need and
// generating them. It takes in the maximum set value (M) and the number
// of set elements (N). To avoid repetition, N cannot be less than M,
// and also it doesn't make any sense for N to be less than 2. But you
// could just call this function with invalid values to deallocate the
// dynamic memory. That'd be much appreciated.

// In order to calculate how much space we need to allocate, we'd like
// to know the maximum number of equivalent pairs a value could have.

// Number of diff pairs can be calculated for a value V by the
// following:
//     M - V - 1    for V <= M / 2
//     M - V        otherwise
// The -1 in the first case is because we have to ignore the case where
// the subtrahend is equal to V.

// Number of quot pairs can be calculated for a value V by the
// following:
//     M / V - 2    for V > 1
// The -2 is also to ignore cases where the dividend and divisor are
// equal to V. It's also worth noting that this uses integer division
// and that the minimum number of pairs is zero.

// Sum pairs only increase for every other value, and prod pairs are
// just kinda nowhere.

// For very small values of M, the value of 1 has the most equivalent
// pairs, due to all the diff pairs you get with low values:
//     M - 2

// When M > 5, the value of 2 has more as 2 gets a lot of quot pairs as
// well:
//     M - 3 + M / 2 - 2
// or:
//     3M / 2 - 5
